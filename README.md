### Motivation
There are over 30,000 auto fatal motor vechicle accidents each year in the United States alone.

The goal of this project is find some trends and make inferences from the traffic accident data. In order improve safety, we must address all factors big and small. The purpose of applying machine learning is to hopefully shed some light onto underlying factors that may contribute to injuries/death. 



## Data Description
The data was obtained from the city of Chicago's data portal. 
This data was collected by the Chicago Police Department and spans from 2015 to 2021 (Although the data set is being updated daily) 
The entire dataset is comprised of three csv files [https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if]

Traffic Crash.csv - 522K rows 49 Columns \
Traffic People.csv - 1.15M rows 30 Columns\
Traffic Vehicle.csv - 1.07M rows 72 Columns

The traffic CRASH_RECORD_ID is used to link the same crash between crashes in the Vehicles and People datasets
